## Getting Started

Ensure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and a package manager ([bun](https://bun.sh)/[pnpm](https://pnpm.io)/[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)/[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)) are installed. Then follow these steps:

### Example Playground

Want to test Relidler before integrating it into your project? Clone the repo and build it using Relidler itself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reliverse/relidler.git
cd relidler
bun i
bun dev # bun src/main.ts --dev
```

### Relidler Usage

1. **Install globally**:

    ```sh
    bun i -g @reliverse/relidler
    ```

    **Or update as needed**:

    ```sh
    bun -g update --latest
    ```

2. **Prepare your project**:

    Ensure your `.gitignore` file excludes log files and distribution directories:

    ```sh
    echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-npm" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-jsr" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-libs" >> .gitignore
    ```

3. **Run and enjoy**:

    ```sh
    relidler
    ```

    The `relidler.cfg.ts` file is created automatically on the first run. **It's recommended to customize this file according to your needs.** While `relidler.cfg.ts` is the recommended name, you may also use: `relidler.config.ts`, `build.cfg.ts`, `build.config.ts (‚ö†Ô∏èsoon)`, or `build.pub.ts`.

## Plugins & SDK

Relidler includes a plugin system with the following built-in plugins available:

- **`libraries-relidler-plugin`**: Builds and publishes specified subdirectories of your main project as separate packages.

### API (for advanced users)

The SDK allows you to create new Relidler plugins and even extend your own CLI functionality.

```sh
bun add -D @reliverse/relidler-sdk # (‚ö†Ô∏èsoon)
```

## TODO

- [x] Implement stable `regular` build and publish
- [ ] Implement stable `library` build and publish
- [ ] Implement automatic migration from `unbuild`
- [ ] Achieve full drop-in replacement for `unbuild`
- [ ] Allow plugins to extend Relidler's `defineConfig`
- [ ] Support configuration via `reliverse.{ts,jsonc}`
- [ ] Make configuration optional with sensible defaults
