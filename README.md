## Getting Started

Ensure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [bun](https://bun.sh)/[pnpm](https://pnpm.io)/[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)/[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed. Then, follow these steps:

### Example Playground

Want to test Relidler before integrating it into your project? Clone the repo and build it with Relidler itself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reliverse/relidler.git
cd relidler
bun i
bun dev # Runs bun src/main.ts --dev
```

### Relidler Usage

1. **Install globally**:

    ```sh
    bun i -g @reliverse/relidler
    ```

    **Or update if needed**:

    ```sh
    bun -g update --latest
    ```

2. **Prepare your project**:

    Ensure that your gitignore includes log files and dist dirs:

    ```sh
    echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-npm" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-jsr" >> .gitignore
    echo "dist-libs" >> .gitignore
    ```

3. **Run and enjoy**:

    ```sh
    relidler
    ```

    The `relidler.cfg.ts` file will be created automatically on the first run. **It's recommended to edit this file according to your needs.** While `relidler.cfg.ts` is the recommended name, the following names are also available: `relidler.config.ts` ‚Ä¢ `build.cfg.ts` ‚Ä¢ `build.config.ts (‚ö†Ô∏èsoon)` ‚Ä¢ `build.pub.ts`.

## Plugins & SDK

Relidler includes a plugin system. The following built-in plugin is already available:

- **`libraries-relidler-plugin`**: Builds and publishes specified subdirectories of the main project's source directory as separate packages.

### API (for advanced users)

The SDK allows you to create new Relidler plugins and even extend your own CLI functionality.

```sh
bun add -D @reliverse/relidler-sdk # (‚ö†Ô∏èsoon)
```

## TODO

- [x] Implement stable `regular` build and publish
- [ ] Implement stable `library` build and publish
- [ ] Implement automatic migration from `unbuild`
- [ ] Achieve full drop-in replacement for `unbuild`
- [ ] Make configuration fully optional using defaults
- [ ] Allow plugins to extend Relidler's `defineConfig`
- [ ] Support configuration via `reliverse.{ts,jsonc}`
